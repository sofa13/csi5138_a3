We chose three learning rates [0.1, 0.01, 0.001], three batch sizes [100, 200, 500], and three dropout percentages [0.1, 0.2, 0.5]. We then created 9 random combinations of the three hyperparameters. Each combination is referred to as a configuration. The 9 configurations are shown in the table below. Note that the same configuration was randomly created twice (config_5 and config_7) and we kept this to see if they would give similar test loss and test accuracy. Note instead of 9 random combinations of the hyperparameters, we could have done all combinations, but it would have taken too long to test all combinations. Instead we relied on 9 random combinations in order to pinpoint obvious hyperparameters that performed well, and then fine tuned further for each state dimension.\n",
